# Agent Context Rules - Chyme Android Project

## File Organization and Placement

### Documentation Files
- **ALWAYS** place documentation files (`.md`, `.txt`, guides, troubleshooting docs) in the `docs/` folder
- **NEVER** place documentation files in the project root or alongside source code files
- Documentation files that should go in `docs/` include:
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Installation guides
  - Configuration guides
  - Helper scripts (`.sh`, `.bat`, etc.) that are for documentation/development purposes
  - Any markdown files that are not part of the deployment/build process

### Files That Should Be Committed
- Only files needed for deployment should be committed to git
- This includes:
  - Source code files
  - Build configuration files (`build.gradle.kts`, `package.json`, etc.)
  - Configuration templates (`local.properties.example`, etc.)
  - Essential project structure files

### Files That Should NOT Be Committed
- Documentation files (go in `docs/` which is typically gitignored)
- Local configuration files (`local.properties`, `.env.local`, etc.)
- Build outputs
- Temporary files

## Project Structure

- Documentation → `docs/`
- Helper scripts → `docs/`
- Build configs → `app/build.gradle.kts` (app level) or `build.gradle.kts` (project level)
- Example configs → `local.properties.example` (root level as template)

### General Rule
When creating any file that is:
- A guide, tutorial, or troubleshooting document
- A helper script for development/documentation purposes
- Not required for the build or deployment process

**Place it in the `docs/` folder.**
