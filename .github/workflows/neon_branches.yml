      # migrations, tests, or send the connection details to a hosting platform.

      # Following the step above, which runs database migrations, you may want to
      # check for schema changes in your database. We recommend using the
      # neondatabase/schema-diff-action to post a comment to your pull request
      # with the schema diff. For this action to work, you also need to give
      # permissions to the workflow job to be able to post comments and read your
      # repository contents. Add the following permissions to the create_neon_branch job:
      #
      # permissions:
      #   contents: read
      #   pull-requests: write
      #
      # You can uncomment the lines below to enable the schema diff action:
